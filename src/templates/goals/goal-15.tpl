	<p>A flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet.We are all part of the planetâ€™s ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural habitats and land degradation. Promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving biodiversity is not a cause. It is the key to our own survival. </p>
